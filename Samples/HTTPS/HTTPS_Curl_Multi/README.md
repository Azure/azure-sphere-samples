# Sample: HTTPS cURL Multi

This sample demonstrates how to use the cURL Multi interface with Azure Sphere over a secure HTTPS connection. For details about using the libcurl library with Azure Sphere, see [Connect to web services using cURL](https://docs.microsoft.com/azure-sphere/app-development/curl).

By default, this sample uses the proxy configured for the device. The sample downloads multiple web pages concurrently by using the cURL Multi interface. The content is output as soon as it arrives. Pressing button A on the MT3620 development board initiates the web transfers. After the sample validates the server identity, communication occurs over HTTP or HTTPS. At the same time, LED1 blinks at a constant rate, demonstrating that the cURL Multi interface is non-blocking.

The sample uses the following Azure Sphere libraries.

| Library | Purpose |
|---------|---------|
| [curl](https://docs.microsoft.com/azure-sphere/reference/baseapis#curl-library) | Configures the data transfer and downloads the web page over HTTP/HTTPS. |
| [eventloop](https://docs.microsoft.com/azure-sphere/reference/applibs-reference/applibs-eventloop/eventloop-overview) | Invokes handlers for timer events. |
| [gpio](https://docs.microsoft.com/azure-sphere/reference/applibs-reference/applibs-gpio/gpio-overview) | Enables digital input for button A. |
| [log](https://docs.microsoft.com/azure-sphere/reference/applibs-reference/applibs-log/log-overview)    | Displays messages in the Device Output window during debugging. |
| [networking](https://docs.microsoft.com/azure-sphere/reference/applibs-reference/applibs-networking/networking-overview) | Gets and sets network interface configuration. |
| [storage](https://docs.microsoft.com/azure-sphere/reference/applibs-reference/applibs-storage/storage-overview)    | Gets the path to the certificate file that is used to authenticate the server. |

## Prerequisites

The sample requires the following hardware:

- An [Azure Sphere development board](https://aka.ms/azurespheredevkits) that supports the [Sample Appliance](../../../HardwareDefinitions) hardware requirements.

   **Note:** By default, the sample targets the [Reference Development Board](https://docs.microsoft.com/azure-sphere/hardware/mt3620-reference-board-design) design, which is implemented by the Seeed Studios MT3620 Development Board. To build the sample for different Azure Sphere hardware, change the value of the TARGET_HARDWARE variable in the `CMakeLists.txt` file. For detailed instructions, see the [Hardware Definitions README](../../../HardwareDefinitions/README.md) file.

## Setup

Complete the following steps to set up this sample.

1. Ensure that your Azure Sphere device is connected to your computer, and your computer is connected to the internet.
1. Even if you've performed this setup previously, ensure that you have Azure Sphere SDK version 21.10 or above. At the command prompt, run **azsphere show-version** to check. Upgrade the Azure Sphere SDK for [Windows](https://docs.microsoft.com/azure-sphere/install/install-sdk) or [Linux](https://docs.microsoft.com/azure-sphere/install/install-sdk-linux) as needed.
1. Enable application development, if you have not already done so, by entering the **azsphere device enable-development** command at the command prompt.
1. Clone the [Azure Sphere samples](https://github.com/Azure/azure-sphere-samples) repository and find the *HTTPS_Curl_Multi* sample in the *HTTPS* folder or download the zip file from the [Microsoft samples browser](https://docs.microsoft.com/samples/azure/azure-sphere-samples/https-curl-multi/).

1. Note that the sample can connect only to websites listed in the **AllowedConnections** capability of the [app_manifest.json](https://docs.microsoft.com/azure-sphere/app-development/app-manifest) file. The sample is set up to connect to the website `httpstat.us`:

    ```json
    "Capabilities": {
        "AllowedConnections": [ "httpstat.us" ],
      },
    ```

    You can revise the sample to connect to a different website for downloading, as described in the [Rebuild the sample to download from a different website](#rebuild-the-sample-to-download-from-a-different-website) section of this README.

1. By default, this sample configures the cURL handle to use the proxy. To bypass the proxy, add `"--BypassProxy"` in the **CmdArgs** field. 

   `CmdArgs: [ "--BypassProxy" ],`

   For further details see [connect through a proxy](https://docs.microsoft.com/azure-sphere/network/connect-through-a-proxy).

1. Configure networking on your device. You must either [set up WiFi](https://docs.microsoft.com/azure-sphere/install/configure-wifi#set-up-wi-fi-on-your-azure-sphere-device) or [set up Ethernet](https://docs.microsoft.com/azure-sphere/network/connect-ethernet) on your development board, depending on the type of network connection you are using.

### Configure a static IP address

You can configure a static IP address on an Ethernet or a Wi-Fi interface. If you have configured a device with a static IP and require name resolution, your application must set a static DNS address. For more information, see the sections *Static IP address* and *Static DNS address* in [Use network services](https://docs.microsoft.com/azure-sphere/network/use-network-services).

### Best practice when using libcurl

When using libcurl, as with other networking applications, the Azure Sphere OS will allocate socket buffers which are attributed to your application's RAM usage. You can tune the size of these buffers to reduce the RAM footprint of your application as appropriate. Refer to [Manage RAM usage](https://docs.microsoft.com/azure-sphere/app-development/ram-usage-best-practices) for further details.

### Make libcurl verbose

When developing and debugging libcurl, you can configure libcurl to display verbose information about its operations on the cURL handle. To make this sample display verbose information, search for the following line in web_client.c

```
if ((res = curl_easy_setopt(easyHandle, CURLOPT_VERBOSE, 0)) != CURLE_OK) {
```

and change it to:

```
if ((res = curl_easy_setopt(easyHandle, CURLOPT_VERBOSE, 1L)) != CURLE_OK) {
```

## Build and run the sample

To build and run this sample, follow the instructions in [Build a sample application](../../../BUILD_INSTRUCTIONS.md).

To start the download, press button A on the board. The sample downloads status information for HTTP statuses 200 (success) and 400 (bad request) from the `httpstat.us` website.

## Rebuild the sample to download from a different website

To download data from a website other than the default website, you'll need to get the root CA certificate from the website, modify the sample to use the new website and its certificate, and build and run the modified sample.

Complete the steps described in the following sections.

### Download the root CA certificate

If the website uses SSL, you may need to use a different root CA certificate. To download the certificate from the website, complete the following steps:

1. Open the browser and click the **Secure** icon, which is a padlock in the address bar.
1. If you're using Microsoft Edge, select **Connection is secure**; then click the certificate icon (highlighted yellow):

    ![certificate icon on web page](./media/download-certificate.png)

1. Select **Certificate**.
1. Open the **Certification Path** tab.
1. Select the top certificate in the hierarchy and then select **View Certificate**.
1. Open the **Details** tab and select **Copy to File**.
1. In the Certificate Export Wizard, click **Next**.
1. Select the Base-64 encoded X.509 (.CER) format and then click **Next**.
1. Type the file name to which to export the certificate and then click **Next**.
1. Click **Finish** to complete the wizard.
1. Rename the downloaded certificate file to have the .pem extension.

### Modify the sample to use the new website

Complete the following steps to modify the sample to use the new website.

1. In the `app_manifest.json` file, add the hostname of the new website to the **AllowedConnections** capability. For example, the following adds `Contoso.com` to the list of allowed websites.

    ```json
    "Capabilities": {
        "AllowedConnections": [ "httpstat.us", "Contoso.com"],
      },
    ```

1. Open `web_client.c`. Find the following code and change `https://httpstat.us/200?sleep=5000` and `https://httpstat.us/400?sleep=1000` to the URLs of the website you want to connect to.

    ```c
    // The web transfers executed with cURL.
    WebTransfer webTransfers[] = {
                // Download a web page with a delay of 5 seconds with status 200.
                {.url = "https://httpstat.us/200?sleep=5000", .easyHandle = NULL},
                // Download a web page with a delay of 1 second with status 400.
                {.url = "https://httpstat.us/400?sleep=1000", .easyHandle = NULL}};
    ```

1. Update the sample to use a different root CA certificate, if necessary:

     1. Put the trusted root CA certificate in the `certs/` folder (and optionally remove the existing `bundle.pem` certificate).
     1. Update line 16 of `CMakeLists.txt` to include the new trusted root CA certificate in the image package, instead of the `bundle.pem` certificate.
     1. Update line 195 of `web_client.c` to point to the new trusted root CA certificate.

### Build and run the sample modified to use the new website

To build and run the modified sample, follow the instructions in the [Build and run the sample](#build-and-run-the-sample) section of this README.
