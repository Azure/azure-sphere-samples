# Sample: HTTPS_Curl_Multi

This sample C application demonstrates how to use the cURL 'multi' API with Azure Sphere over a secure HTTPS connection. For details about using the libcurl library with Azure Sphere, see [Connect to web services using curl](https://docs.microsoft.com/azure-sphere/app-development/curl).

The sample downloads multiple web pages concurrently by using the cURL 'multi' interface. The content is output as soon as it arrives. Pressing button A on the MT3620 development board initiates the web transfers. After the sample validates the server identity, communication occurs over HTTP or HTTPS. At the same time, LED1 blinks at a constant rate, demonstrating that the cURL 'multi' 
interface is non-blocking.

By default, this sample runs over a Wi-Fi connection to the internet. To use Ethernet instead, make the following changes:

1. Configure Azure Sphere as described in [Connect Azure Sphere to Ethernet](https://docs.microsoft.com/azure-sphere/network/connect-ethernet).
1. Add an Ethernet adapter to your hardware. If you are using an MT3620 RDB, see the [wiring instructions](../../../Hardware/mt3620_rdb/EthernetWiring.md).
1. Add the following line to the Capabilities section of the app_manifest.json file:
   `"NetworkConfig" : true`
1. In main.c, add a call to `Networking_SetInterfaceState` before any other networking calls:

   ```c
    int err = Networking_SetInterfaceState("eth0", true);
    if (err == -1) {
        Log_Debug("Error setting interface state %d\n",errno);
        return -1;
    }
   ```

The sample uses the following Azure Sphere libraries:

|Library   |Purpose  |
|---------|---------|
| gpio | Enables digital input for button A |
|log     |  Displays messages in the Visual Studio Device Output window during debugging  |
|storage    | Gets the path to the certificate file that is used to authenticate the server      |
|libcurl | Configures the transfer and downloads the web page |

## Prerequisites

The sample requires the following hardware:

1. [Seeed MT3620 Development Kit](https://aka.ms/azurespheredevkits) or other hardware that implements the [MT3620 Reference Development Board (RDB)](https://docs.microsoft.com/azure-sphere/hardware/mt3620-reference-board-design) design.

**Note:** By default, this sample targets [MT3620 reference development board (RDB)](https://docs.microsoft.com/azure-sphere/hardware/mt3620-reference-board-design) hardware, such as the MT3620 development kit from Seeed Studio. To build the sample for different Azure Sphere hardware, change the Target Hardware Definition Directory in the project properties. For detailed instructions, see the [README file in the Hardware folder](../../../Hardware/README.md).

## Prepare the sample

1. Ensure that your Azure Sphere device is connected to your computer,  andyour computer is connected to the internet.
1. Even if you've performed this setup previously, ensure that you have Azure Sphere SDK version 20.04 or above. At the command prompt, run **azsphere show-version** to check. Install the Azure Sphere SDK for [Windows](https://docs.microsoft.com/azure-sphere/install/install-sdk) or [Linux](https://docs.microsoft.com/azure-sphere/install/install-sdk-linux) as needed.
1.Enable application development, if you have not already done so, by entering the following line at the command prompt:

   `azsphere device enable-development`

1. Clone the [Azure Sphere samples](https://github.com/Azure/azure-sphere-samples) repo and find the HTTPS_Curl_Multi_HighLevelApp sample in the HTTPS folder.

## Set up hardware to display output

To prepare your hardware to display output from the sample, see "Set up hardware to display output" for [Windows](https://docs.microsoft.com/azure-sphere/install/development-environment-windows#set-up-hardware-to-display-output) or [Linux](https://docs.microsoft.com/azure-sphere/install/development-environment-linux#set-up-hardware-to-display-output).

## Build and run the sample

See the following Azure Sphere Quickstarts to learn how to build and deploy this sample:

   -  [with Visual Studio](https://docs.microsoft.com/azure-sphere/install/qs-blink-application)
   -  [with VS Code](https://docs.microsoft.com/azure-sphere/install/qs-blink-vscode)
   -  [on the Windows command line](https://docs.microsoft.com/azure-sphere/install/qs-blink-cli)
   -  [on the Linux command line](https://docs.microsoft.com/azure-sphere/install/qs-blink-linux-cli)

## To start the download

1. Press button A on the board to start download.

The sample downloads status information for HTTP statuses 200 (success) and 400 (bad request) from the httpstat.us website.  

The sample can only connect to websites listed in the application manifest. In the "AllowedConnections" section of the app_manifest.json file, add the host name of each website to which you want the sample to connect. For example, the following adds Contoso.com to the list of allowed websites.

```json
"Capabilities": {
    "AllowedConnections": ["httpstat.us", "Contoso.com"],
     .
     .
     .
  }
```
