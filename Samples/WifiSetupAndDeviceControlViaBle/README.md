# Sample: Wi-Fi setup and device control via BLE - reference solution

This reference solution demonstrates how you might [complete Wi-Fi setup and device control](https://docs.microsoft.com/azure-sphere/network/wifi-including-ble) of an Azure Sphere-based device through Bluetooth Low Energy (BLE) using a companion app on a mobile device. This solution utilizes a Nordic nRF52 Development Kit to provide BLE connectivity over UART to the Azure Sphere MT3620 board, and a Windows 10 app to illustrate the companion user experience. 

For more information on the design of this sample solution see the [Design overview](./design-overview.md) article.

## Preparation

This reference solution requires the following:

- Azure Sphere SDK version 19.02 or above. In an Azure Sphere Developer Command Prompt, run **azsphere show-version** to check. Download and install the [latest SDK](https://aka.ms/AzureSphereSDKDownload) if needed.
- Azure Sphere MT3620 board
- Nordic nRF52 BLE development board
- Jumper wires to connect the boards to each other
- Two free USB ports to connect both boards to your computer
- BLE support on your computer, either through internal hardware or external hardware such as a USB BLE dongle
- Windows 10 Fall Creators edition (1709) or newer, which is required for its updated BLE support
- Developer Mode on Windows, which enables installation of the sample Windows 10 companion app

To set Windows to use Developer Mode:
1. In Settings, click **Update & Security**, and then click **For Developers**.
1. Under **Use developer features** select **Developer mode**.

## Connect Azure Sphere MT3620 to the Nordic nRF52

Make the following connections between the nRF52 and MT3620 dev boards using the jumper wires:

- nRF52 RX: P0.11 to MT3620 UART0 TX: Header 2 (lower left) Pin 3
- nRF52 TX: P0.12 to MT3620 UART0 RX: Header 2 (lower left) Pin 1
- nRF52 CTS: P0.23 to MT3620 UART0 RTS: Header 2 (lower left) Pin 7
- nRF52 RTS: P0.22 to MT3620 UART0 CTS: Header 2 (lower left) Pin 5
- nRF52 Reset: P0.21 to MT3620 GPIO5: Header 2 (lower left) Pin 4
- nRF52 DFU: P0.16 to MT3620 GPIO44: Header 2 (lower left) Pin 14
- nRF52 Ground: GND to MT3620 GND: Header 2 (lower left) Pin 2

Refer to the following graphic for details.

## Install the nRF52 app on the nRF52 Development Kit

1. Clone the samples repo, if you haven't already done so:
 
    ```sh
    git clone https://github.com/Azure/azure-sphere-samples.git
    ```

1. Connect the nRF52 developer board to your computer using USB. After connection, the nRF52 displays a JLINK removable drive in Windows.
1. Find the nRF52 binary at WifiSetupAndDeviceControlViaBle/Binaries/softdevice_WifiSetupAndDeviceControlViaBleApp.hex.
1. Copy this file to the root of the JLINK removable drive. After the file is copied, the nRF52 restarts automatically and runs the sample application.

## Run the Azure Sphere app

1. Open WifiSetupAndDeviceControlViaBle/AzureSphereApp/WifiSetupAndDeviceControlViaBle.sln in Visual Studio.
1. Build and debug the application (F5).
1. Wait for notification that the nRF52 app is active and advertising its availability to connect to known ("bonded") BLE devices. LED 2 on the MT3620 will light up blue when this is complete.
1. Note the randomly generated device name in the Output window in Visual Studio. You will use this name to identify the BLE connection in a subsequent step. The name is similar to *Azure_Sphere_BLE_123456*.

### Troubleshooting the Azure Sphere app

If an error similar to the following appears in the Visual Studio Build output when you build the Azure Sphere app, you probably have an outdated version of the Azure Sphere SDK:

   `mt3620_rdb.h:9:10: fatal error: soc/mt3620_i2cs.h: No such file or directory`

## Run the Windows 10 companion app on your PC

This Windows app allows you to use your development PC to simulate a mobile app that uses the BLE connection to the nRF52 to configure Wi-Fi setup and device control on the Azure Sphere device. It provides reference code that can be ported to other platforms.

1. Start a separate instance of Visual Studio.
1. Open WifiSetupAndDeviceControlViaBle/WindowsApp/WifiSetupAndDeviceControlViaBle.sln.
1. Build and debug the application (F5). If this is your first time developing Universal Windows Platform (UWP) applications on this computer, you may be required to download the Universal Windows Platform Development workload.

## Configure the Wi-Fi settings

1. Press button A on the MT3620 board. The Azure Sphere app requests that the nRF52 app advertise its availability to connect to a new BLE device for the next 60 seconds. LED 2 on the MT3620 should light up red. 
1. In the Windows 10 companion app, click the **Scan for devices** button at the top to scan for BLE devices.
1. Select your device from the list. It has the name you noted earlier in the [Run the Azure Sphere app](#run-the-azure-sphere-app) step.
1. Click **Connect**. LED 2 on the MT3620 lights up green to indicate a BLE device (the Windows 10 computer) is connected to the nRF52, and a PIN appears in the Output window in the Visual Studio instance for the Azure Sphere app. The nRF52 doesn't yet trust this BLE device.
1. When prompted, type the passkey you noted earlier. When the connection is confirmed, the nRF52 app will remember the Windows 10 computer as a known and trusted BLE device and allow it to read and write values over BLE. The Windows 10 companion app will now be able to read and display the current Wi-Fi status on the MT3620.
1. If there is no active Wi-Fi network, click **Add new network...**. If an active network is present, press and hold button B on the MT3620 development board for at least three seconds to delete it.
1. Click **Scan for Wi-Fi networks**. It may take a few seconds to display a complete list of networks that the Azure Sphere device can see. Only open and WPA2 networks are supported.
1. If the network is secured, a prompt appears for a network password. Enter the password and then click **Connect**. If you are connecting to an open network, simply click **Connect**.
1. Observe that the current Wi-Fi status is displayed again and refreshed every 5 seconds. You should see the Azure Sphere device connect to the new Wi-Fi network successfully.

If you are running the Azure Sphere and Windows apps in debug mode in Visual Studio, the Output window should show the protocol communications they are sending and receiving. If you do not see the messages, check that the wiring between the boards is correct, or reset the boards and restart the debugging session.

## Monitor and control device behavior

1. Press button B on the MT3620 dev board. Observe that LED3 on the board lights up green, and that this On/Off state is soon reflected in the **Device Status** screen of the companion app.
1. Press the **Switch Off** (or **Switch On**) UWP toggle switch on the **Device Status** screen. Observe that LED3 on the board becomes green, and that the new On/Off state is soon reflected on screen, after the device has confirmed the change.

## Manage known companion devices

1. Close the Windows 10 companion app. The LED 2 on the MT3620 lights up blue to indicate the nRF52 has no connected device and is advertising only to known (“bonded”) BLE devices.
1. Restart the Windows 10 companion app and connect to the nRF52 BLE device again. Observe the LED 2 on the MT3620 board lights up green again. This time there is no need to press the button or enter the passkey.
1. Press button A on the MT3620 board and hold it down for 3 seconds. The Azure Sphere app requests that the nRF52 forget all known devices. The LED turns blue (advertising only to known devices), although in practice this means that no device can currently connect because all known devices have just been deleted. 
1. Delete the pairing for the nRF52 in your Windows Bluetooth settings so that you can create a new bond.
1. Repeat the steps in **Configure the Wifi Settings** section above, beginning with a short press of button A, to enable the companion app to connect again.
1. Repeat these steps again on another PC to add a second companion app. However, when you press button A to add the second companion, the first app is disconnected; while the nRF52 can trust (“bond”) multiple BLE devices, only one device can be connected at a time.
1. Note that if the nRF52 app is re-deployed directly from the PC (see **Build your own solution** below for instructions) then all known companion devices are forgotten. If the nRF52 app is redeployed via the [External MCU update sample](../ExternalMcuUpdateNrf52/README.md), then all companion devices are remembered. 

## Build your own solution

To edit and re-deploy the Azure Sphere and Windows apps, use Visual Studio as in the steps above.

To edit and re-deploy the nRF52 app:

1. Download and install [SEGGER Embedded Studio](https://www.segger.com/downloads/embedded-studio). [Download the 32-bit version](https://www.segger.com/downloads/embedded-studio/EmbeddedStudio_ARM_Win_x86), not the 64-bit version. Ensure that you are licensed to use it for your purposes. In Oct. 2018, we were able to [obtain the license for free because we were developing for NRF52](https://www.segger.com/news/segger-embedded-studio-ide-now-free-for-nordic-sdk-users/).
1. Install (download and extract) the [Nordic NRF5 SDK V15.2](https://www.nordicsemi.com/eng/Products/Bluetooth-low-energy/nRF5-SDK#Downloads)
1. Edit the nRF52 sample app so you can build it against your SDK:
    - Use a text editor to open WifiSetupAndDeviceControlViaBle\Nrf52App\pca10040\s132\ses\ble_app_uart_pca10040_s132.emProject.
    - Set the SDK_ROOT variable in this file to point to the root directory of your Nordic SDK install. Specifically, replace the words "CHANGE_THIS_TO_YOUR_NORDIC_SDK_PATH" with the correct path, changing any backslashes ("\") to forward slashes ("/") in the path. For example: macros="SDK_ROOT=C:/Users/ExampleUser/source/nRF5_SDK_15.2.0_9412b96;…"
1. Open this .emProject file in the Segger IDE.
1. Build and debug the application (F5).

In production solutions, it is highly recommended to enable remote update of this firmware. Please see the [reference solution for external MCU update](https://github.com/Azure/azure-sphere-samples/tree/master/Samples/ExternalMcuUpdateNrf52) for more details.

## Troubleshooting the nRF52 

If you encounter a situation where the nRF52 BLE board seems to be unresponsive, try the following.

First, check that the JLINK drive is displayed in Windows Explorer. If the JLINK drive does appear, reset the nRF52 board.

If the JLINK drive does not appear in Windows Explorer, try the following: 

1. On the nRF52 board, hold the reset button while switching the power off and then back on. This should load the Jlink bootloader and a BOOTLOADER drive should be displayed in Windows Explorer. LED 5 should blink.
1. Download the [Jlink bootloader](https://www.nordicsemi.com/Software-and-Tools/Development-Kits/nRF52-DK/Download#infotabs) (on the Downloads tab, file J-Link OB-SAM3U128-V2-NordicSemi 170724.bin) from NordicSemi.com.
1. Copy the Jlink OB-SAM3U128-V2-NordicSemi 170724.bin file to the BOOTLOADER drive.
1. Turn off the power on the nRF52 board and then turn the power on. Check that the JLINK drive appears in Windows Explorer. LED 5 should be lit (no longer blinking).

If these steps don't resolve the problem, contact Nordic for more help.
