# Component
This code is based on the Nordic UART over BLE sample application, with modifications made by Microsoft to change:
- The Makefile to include new or modified files 
- The SEGGER Embedded Studio project file to include new or modified files 
- The SDK configuration header file(sdk_config.h) to manage the static configuration of the application that is built on top of nRF5 SDK
- Added a custom board support file(custom_board.h) to define the peripherals for the selected platform. Please refer to the nRF52 documentation [Nordic infocenter] (https://infocenter.nordicsemi.com/index.jsp?topic=%2Fcom.nordic.infocenter.sdk5.v15.2.0%2Fsdk_for_custom_boards.html&resultof=%22Using%22%20%22us%22%20%22SDK%22%20%22sdk%22%20%22other%22%20%22boards%22%20%22board%22%20) for more information.
