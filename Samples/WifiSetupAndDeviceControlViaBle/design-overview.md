# Sample: Wi-Fi setup and device control via BLE - Design overview

The Azure Sphere application:

- Uses a custom, extensible message-passing protocol to communicate with both the nRF52 Application (via UART) and the Windows Application (via UART and then Bluetooth LE (BLE))
- Instructs the nRF52 application whether to allow new connections from unknown devices, what device name to use, whether to delete all BLE bonds, and what passkey to require. Note: whenever the Azure Sphere app restarts, it may be desirable for it to provide the same device name to the nRF52. This can be done by storing the name, when it is first generated, in [Mutable storage](https://docs.microsoft.com/azure-sphere/app-development/storage#using-mutable-storage). 
- Communicates with the Windows companion app to send and receive messages â€” see Protocol Specification below
- Manages the state of LED 2:
    - Off: nRF52 is not advertising (only seen briefly on app startup, unless nRF device is not connected properly)
    - Red: nRF52 is advertising and open to bonding for all devices
    - Blue: nRF52 is advertising only for existing bonded devices
    - Green: nRF52 is connected to a remote device and is not currently advertising
    - Yellow: nRF52 is uninitialized
    - Magenta: nRF52 is in an error state
- Manages the functionality of the MT3620 buttons:
    - Short press of button A: MT3620 instructs nRF52 that a new BLE bond to be formed (assuming the bonding device can provide the passkey). This has the side-effect of disconnecting any BLE device currently connected.
    - Long press of button A: MT3620 instructs nRF52 to delete all bonds. This disconnects any BLE device that is connected.
    - Short press of button B: MT3620 toggles the LED 3 status. If a BLE device is connected through the nRF52, then it is notified of the LED 3 status being changed.
    - Long press of button B: MT3620 deletes all of its stored Wi-Fi network information and disconnects from any currently connected Wi-Fi networks.

The Nordic nRF52 application:

- Sets up BLE under the control of the Azure Sphere application
- Forwards messages between the Windows application (communicating via BLE) and the Azure Sphere application (communicating via UART)

The Windows 10 application:

- Uses the Universal Windows Platform (UWP)
- Uses a portable class library (PCL)-based DLL to enable connection to an MT3620 device via BLE

## Extensible Protocol

This reference solution includes a custom, extensible message-passing protocol between the MT3620, the nRF52, and the user's BLE device. The protocol is transported via UART from the MT3620 to the nRF52. The nRF52 application looks for messages using the *BLE Control* category, and responds to those directly. For all other messages, the nRF52 forwards those messages over BLE to a connected and bonded BLE device, if present. Similarly, the nRF52 forwards any incoming message from a remote BLE device to the nRF52. The communication over BLE uses a pair of BLE characteristics "TX" and "RX" - this places a size limit on the messages. Those characteristics are only readable and writable by a bonded BLE device, which is important for secured communication.

The protocol is designed to be extensible, by adding or modifying message types in an existing category, or by introducing new categories of message.

The protocol definitions and key sequences of messages are detailed further below.

### Requests, responses and events

The protocol is based around a simple request/response/event pattern. The Azure Sphere application issues requests, the nRF52 (or the remote BLE device, communicating via the nRF52) responds. These requests and responses have a custom set of parameters for each message type. The Azure Sphere application guarantees to only issue one request at a time, unless there is a timeout; this simplifies the logic required on the nRF52 and the remote device. The nRF52 and remote device can signal asynchronous events with an "event" message at any time, these events do not have parameters, but once the protocol is "idle" (i.e. after any outstanding request has had its response), the Azure Sphere application issues further request(s)/response(s) as necessary to handle the event.

### Definitions

- **Length:** uint16 - The message length excluding the preamble and length fields
- **Sequence number:** uint16 - The response uses the corresponding request's sequence number
- **Response result:** uint8 - 0 indicates success, >0 indicates error code 
- **Message type:**

- **Category IDs:**

The requests/responses/events are divided into categories each handled by a different source file. This enables different functionalities to be implemented in a modular way on top of the protocol, for example Wi-Fi setup and device control.
