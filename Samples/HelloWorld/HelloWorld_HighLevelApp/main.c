// This minimal Azure Sphere app repeatedly toggles GPIO 8, which is the red channel of RGB
// LED 1 on the MT3620 RDB. Use this app to test that device and SDK installation succeeded
// that you can build, deploy, and debug a CMake app with Visual Studio.
//
// It uses the API for the following Azure Sphere application libraries:
// - gpio (digital input for button)
// - log (displays messages in the Device Output window during debugging)

#include <stdbool.h>
#include <errno.h>
#include <string.h>
#include <time.h>

#include <applibs/log.h>
#include <applibs/gpio.h>

// The following #include imports a "sample appliance" hardware definition. This provides a set of
// named constants such as SAMPLE_BUTTON_1 which are used when opening the peripherals, rather
// that using the underlying pin names. This enables the same code to target different hardware.
//
// By default, this app targets hardware that follows the MT3620 Reference Development Board (RDB)
// specification, such as the MT3620 Dev Kit from Seeed Studio. To target different hardware, you'll
// need to update the TARGET_HARDWARE variable in CMakeLists.txt - see instructions in that file.
//
// You can also use hardware definitions related to all other peripherals on your dev board because
// the sample_appliance header file recursively includes underlying hardware definition headers.
// See https://aka.ms/azsphere-samples-hardwaredefinitions for further details on this feature.
