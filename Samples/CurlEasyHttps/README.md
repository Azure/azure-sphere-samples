# Sample: CurlEasyHttps

This sample C application demonstrates how to use the cURL "easy" API with Azure Sphere over a secure HTTPS connection. For details about using the libcurl library with Azure Sphere, see [Connect to web services using curl](https://docs.microsoft.com/azure-sphere/app-development/curl).

The sample periodically downloads the index web page at example.com, by using cURL over a secure HTTPS connection.
It uses the cURL "easy" API, which is a synchronous (blocking) API.

The sample uses [beta APIs](https://docs.microsoft.com/azure-sphere/app-development/use-beta) and the following Azure Sphere libraries:

|Library   |Purpose  |
|---------|---------|
|log     |  Displays messages in the Visual Studio Device Output window during debugging  |
|storage    | Gets the path to the certificate file that is used to authenticate the server      |
|libcurl | Configures the transfer and downloads the web page |

## To build and run the sample

1. Set up your Azure Sphere device and development environment as described in the [Azure Sphere documentation](https://docs.microsoft.com/azure-sphere/install/overview).
1. Even if you've performed this set up previously, ensure you have Azure Sphere SDK version 19.02 or above. In an Azure Sphere Developer Command Prompt, run **azsphere show-version** to check. Download and install the [latest SDK](https://aka.ms/AzureSphereSDKDownload) as needed.
1. Clone the Azure Sphere samples repo and then open the CurlEasyHttps sample from within your copy.
1. Connect your Azure Sphere device to your PC by USB.
1. Enable [Wi-Fi](https://docs.microsoft.com/azure-sphere/install/configure-wifi) and [application development](https://docs.microsoft.com/azure-sphere/quickstarts/qs-blink-application#prepare-your-device-for-development-and-debugging) on your Azure Sphere device, if you have not already done so.
1. In Visual Studio, open CurlEasyHttps.sln and press F5 to compile and build the solution and load it onto the device for debugging.

### Troubleshooting

If you see numerous errors in the Visual Studio Error List relating to missing headers and undefined identifiers, or if when building the app, you see the following error in the Visual Studio Build Output:

   `error MSB6004: The specified task executable location "C:\Program Files (x86)\Microsoft Azure Sphere SDK\\SysRoot\tools\gcc\arm-poky-linux-musleabi-gcc.exe" is invalid.`

Then it is likely you have an older version of the Azure Sphere SDK installed; ensure you have version 19.02 or newer.
