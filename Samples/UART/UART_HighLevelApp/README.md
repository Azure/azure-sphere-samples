# Sample: UART high-level app

This sample demonstrates how to communicate over the UART on an MT3620 development board.

This sample does the following:

- Opens a UART serial port with a baud rate of 115200.
- Sends characters from the device over the UART when button A is pressed.
- Displays the data received from the UART in the Output Window of Visual Studio or Visual Studio Code.
- Causes an LED to blink when data is received from the UART.

The sample uses the following Azure Sphere libraries.

| Library | Purpose |
|---------|---------|
| [eventloop](https://docs.microsoft.com/azure-sphere/reference/applibs-reference/applibs-eventloop/eventloop-overview) | Invokes handlers for I/O and timer events. |
| [gpio](https://docs.microsoft.com/azure-sphere/reference/applibs-reference/applibs-gpio/gpio-overview) | Manages button A on the device. |
| [log](https://docs.microsoft.com/azure-sphere/reference/applibs-reference/applibs-log/log-overview) | Displays messages in the Device Output window during debugging. |
| [uart](https://docs.microsoft.com/azure-sphere/reference/applibs-reference/applibs-uart/uart-overview) | Manages UART connectivity on the device. |

## Prerequisites

- An [Azure Sphere development board](https://aka.ms/azurespheredevkits) that supports the [Sample Appliance](../../../HardwareDefinitions) hardware requirements.

   **Note:** By default, the sample targets the [Reference Development Board](https://docs.microsoft.com/azure-sphere/hardware/mt3620-reference-board-design) design, which is implemented by the Seeed Studios MT3620 Development Board. To build the sample for different Azure Sphere hardware, change the value of the TARGET_HARDWARE variable in the `CMakeLists.txt` file. For detailed instructions, see the [Hardware Definitions README](../../../HardwareDefinitions/README.md) file.

- Make a loopback connection on header 2 (marked H2) on the lower left side of the board by connecting pins 1 and 3 (ISU0 RXD and ISU0 TXD) of H2 with a jumper. Pins 1 and 3 are the first two pins on the left side of the header, circled in red in the image.

- As an alternative to using the loopback connection, you can connect the UART to an external serial-USB interface board and use a client such as Telnet or Putty to transmit and receive bytes. This solution has been tested using the Adafruit FTDI Friend serial-USB adapter with the following wiring connections.

   ![Connections for MT3620 and FTDI Friend](./media/MT3620_FTDI-Friend-2.png)

   | FTDI Friend | Azure Sphere MT3620 |
   | ----------- | ------------------- |
   | GND         | H2 Pin 2            |
   | TX          | H2 Pin 1            |
   | RX          | H2 Pin 3            |
   | RTS         | H2 Pin 5            |
   | CTS         | H2 Pin 7            |

   **Putty settings:**

   - Local echo = force on
   - Local line editing = force on

## Setup

1. Even if you've performed this setup previously, ensure you have Azure Sphere SDK version 21.10 or above. At the command prompt, run **azsphere show-version** to check. Install [the Azure Sphere SDK](https://docs.microsoft.com/azure-sphere/install/install-sdk) as needed.
1. Connect your Azure Sphere device to your computer by USB.
1. Enable application development, if you have not already done so, by entering the **azsphere device enable-development** command at the command prompt.
1. Clone the [Azure Sphere samples](https://github.com/Azure/azure-sphere-samples) repository and find the *UART_HighLevelApp* sample in the *UART* folder or download the zip file from the [Microsoft samples browser](https://docs.microsoft.com/samples/azure/azure-sphere-samples/uart/).

## Build and run the sample

To build and run this sample, follow the instructions in [Build a sample application](../../../BUILD_INSTRUCTIONS.md).

### Test the sample

Press button A on the board. This sends 13 bytes over the UART connection and displays the sent and received text in the **Device Output** window, if you're using Visual Studio or Visual Studio Code:

`Sent 13 bytes over UART in 1 calls.`  
`UART received 12 bytes: 'Hello world!'.`  
`UART received 1 bytes: '`  
`'.`

**Note:** If you are using the serial-USB adapter, you will not see the lines starting `UART received`, but instead you will be able to see the output on your PC serial client.

The received text might not appear all at the same time and it might not appear immediately.

The message may contain more bytes than the **read** function can return, depending on the Azure Sphere device (on the MT3620 this is often 12 bytes). The message may need to be assembled asynchronously over a sequence of **read** calls as a result, as illustrated at [this point](https://github.com/Azure/azure-sphere-samples/blob/7232fcb52a493b7def65c50ea93ab9bb73e283c2/Samples/WifiSetupAndDeviceControlViaBle/AzureSphereApp/WifiSetupAndDeviceControlViaBle/message_protocol.c#L214) in the WifiSetupAndDeviceControlViaBle sample.

If it is temporarily not possible to send further bytes, such as when transmitting larger buffers, the **write** function may fail with errno of **EAGAIN**. You can handle this by registering an **EPOLLOUT** event handler, as illustrated at [this point](https://github.com/Azure/azure-sphere-samples/blob/7232fcb52a493b7def65c50ea93ab9bb73e283c2/Samples/WifiSetupAndDeviceControlViaBle/AzureSphereApp/WifiSetupAndDeviceControlViaBle/message_protocol.c#L276) in the WifiSetupAndDeviceControlViaBle sample.
