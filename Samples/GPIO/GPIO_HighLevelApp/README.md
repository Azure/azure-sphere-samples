# Sample: GPIO high-level app

This application does the following:

- Provides access to one of the LEDs on the MT3620 development board using GPIO
- Uses a button to change the blink rate of the LED

The sample uses the following Azure Sphere libraries.

| Library | Purpose |
|---------|---------|
| [GPIO](https://docs.microsoft.com/azure-sphere/reference/applibs-reference/applibs-gpio/gpio-overview) | Manages button A and LED 1 on the device |
| [log](https://docs.microsoft.com/azure-sphere/reference/applibs-reference/applibs-log/log-overview) | Displays messages in the Device Output window during debugging |
| [EventLoop](https://docs.microsoft.com/azure-sphere/reference/applibs-reference/applibs-eventloop/eventloop-overview) | Invoke handlers for timer events |

## Prerequisites

The sample requires the following hardware:

* [Seeed MT3620 Development Kit](https://aka.ms/azurespheredevkits) or other hardware that implements the [MT3620 Reference Development Board (RDB)](https://docs.microsoft.com/azure-sphere/hardware/mt3620-reference-board-design) design.

**Note:** By default, this sample targets [MT3620 reference development board (RDB)](https://docs.microsoft.com/azure-sphere/hardware/mt3620-reference-board-design) hardware, such as the MT3620 development kit from Seeed Studio. To build the sample for different Azure Sphere hardware, change the Target Hardware Definition Directory in the CMakeLists.txt file. For detailed instructions, see the [README file in the HardwareDefinitions folder](../../../HardwareDefinitions/README.md).

## Prepare the sample

1. Ensure that your Azure Sphere device is connected to your computer, and your computer is connected to the internet.
1. Even if you've performed this setup previously, ensure that you have Azure Sphere SDK version 21.01 or above. At the command prompt, run **azsphere show-version** to check. Upgrade the Azure Sphere SDK for [Windows](https://docs.microsoft.com/azure-sphere/install/install-sdk) or [Linux](https://docs.microsoft.com/azure-sphere/install/install-sdk-linux) as needed.
1. Enable application development, if you have not already done so, by entering the following line at the command prompt:

   `azsphere device enable-development`

1. Clone the [Azure Sphere samples](https://github.com/Azure/azure-sphere-samples) repository and find the *GPIO_HighLevelApp* sample in the *GPIO* folder or download the zip file from the [Microsoft samples browser](https://docs.microsoft.com/samples/azure/azure-sphere-samples/gpio/).

## Build and run the sample

To build and run this sample, follow the instructions in [Build a sample application](../../../BUILD_INSTRUCTIONS.md).

## Test the sample

 LED1 on the MT3620 begins blinking red.

 Press button A repeatedly to cycle through the 3 possible blink rates.
