# Sample: I2C_LSM6DS3_HighLevelApp

This sample C application demonstrates how to use [I2C with Azure Sphere](https://docs.microsoft.com/azure-sphere/app-development/i2c) in a high-level application. The sample displays data from an ST LSM6DS3 accelerometer connected to an MT3620 development board through I2C (Inter-Integrated Circuit). The accelerometer data is retrieved every second and is displayed by calling the [Applibs I2C APIs](https://docs.microsoft.com/azure-sphere/reference/applibs-reference/i2c/i2c-overview).

The sample uses the following Azure Sphere libraries and includes [beta APIs](https://docs.microsoft.com/azure-sphere/app-development/use-beta).

## Prerequisites

 This sample requires the following hardware:

- Azure Sphere device
   
   **NOTE:** By default, this sample targets [MT3620 reference development board (RDB)](https://docs.microsoft.com/azure-sphere/hardware/mt3620-reference-board-design) hardware, such as the MT3620 development kit from Seeed Studios. To build the sample for different Azure Sphere hardware, change the Target Hardware Definition Directory in the project properties. For detailed instructions, see the [README file in the Hardware folder](../../../Hardware/README.md). You might also need to wire the boards differently; check with your hardware manufacturer for details. 

- [ST LSM6DS3](https://www.st.com/en/mems-and-sensors/lsm6ds3.html)
- 2 x 10K ohm resistors
- We recommend a breadboard because this sample requires wiring from multiple sources to the same pin and the use of pull-up resistors.
- Jumper wires to connect the boards.

Make the following connections between the ST LSM6DS3 and MT3620 dev boards. Make sure that power is disconnected while you wire the boards.

**Note:** this sample uses ISU2 on the MT3620 board; however, you can use another ISU by adjusting the wiring, the code, and the application manifest.

## To build and run the sample

1. Set up your Azure Sphere device and development environment as described in the [Azure Sphere documentation](https://docs.microsoft.com/azure-sphere/install/install).
1. Even if you've performed this set up previously, ensure you have Azure Sphere SDK version 19.05 or above. In an Azure Sphere Developer Command Prompt, run **azsphere show-version** to check. Download and install the [latest SDK](https://aka.ms/AzureSphereSDKDownload) as needed.
1. Connect your Azure Sphere device to your PC by USB.
1. Enable [application development](https://docs.microsoft.com/azure-sphere/quickstarts/qs-blink-application#prepare-your-device-for-development-and-debugging), if you have not already done so:

   `azsphere device prep-debug`
1. Clone the [Azure Sphere samples](https://github.com/Azure/azure-sphere-samples) repo and find the I2C_LSM6DS3_HighLevelApp sample in the I2C folder.
1. In Visual Studio, open I2C_LSM6DS3_HighLevelApp.sln and press F5 to compile and build the solution and load it onto the device for debugging.

## Test the accelerometer data

When you run the application, it reads the WHO_AM_I register from the accelerometer. This should return the known value 0x69, which confirms that the MT3620 can successfully communicate with the accelerometer. If this fails, verify that the devices are wired correctly, and that the application opened the correct I2C interface. For details on the registers, see the [ST LSM6DS3 data sheet](https://www.st.com/resource/en/datasheet/lsm6ds3.pdf).

After displaying the initial values, the application configures the accelerometer and then displays the vertical acceleration every second.

To test the accelerometer data:

1. Keep the device still, and observe the accelerometer output in the **Output Window**. Once the data from the CTRL3_C register is displayed, the output should repeat every second.

1. Turn the accelerometer upside down and observe the updated data in the **Output Window**. The vertical acceleration should change from approximately +1g to approximately -1g.

## Troubleshooting the Azure Sphere app

- Visual Studio returns the following error if the application fails to compile:

   `1>C:\Program Files (x86)\Microsoft Visual Studio\2017\Enterprise\Common7\IDE\VC\VCTargets\Application Type\Linux\1.0\AzureSphere.targets(105,5): error MSB6006: "arm-poky-linux-musleabi-gcc.exe" exited with code 1.`

   This error may occur for many reasons. Most often, the reason is that you did not clone the entire Azure Sphere Samples repository from GitHub. The samples depend on the hardware definition files that are supplied in the Hardware folder of the repository.

### To get detailed error information

By default, Visual Studio may only open the Error List panel, so that you see error messages like this:

`1>C:\Program Files (x86)\Microsoft Visual Studio\2017\Enterprise\Common7\IDE\VC\VCTargets\Application Type\Linux\1.0\AzureSphere.targets(105,5): error MSB6006: "arm-poky-linux-musleabi-gcc.exe" exited with code 1.`

To get more information, open the Build Output window. To open the window, select **View->Output**, then choose **Build** on the drop-down menu. The Build menu shows additional detail, for example:

```
1>------ Rebuild All started: Project: AzureIoT, Configuration: Debug ARM ------
1>main.c:36:10: fatal error: hw/sample_hardware.h: No such file or directory
1> #include <hw/sample_hardware.h>
1>          ^~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
1>compilation terminated.
1>C:\Program Files (x86)\Microsoft Visual Studio\2017\Enterprise\Common7\IDE\VC\VCTargets\Application Type\Linux\1.0\AzureSphere.targets(105,5): error MSB6006: "arm-poky-linux-musleabi-gcc.exe" exited with code 1.
1>Done building project "AzureIoT.vcxproj" -- FAILED.
========== Rebuild All: 0 succeeded, 1 failed, 0 skipped ==========
```

In this case, the error is that hardware definition files aren't available.

The **Tools -> Options -> Projects and Solutions -> Build and Run** panel provides further controls for build verbosity.
