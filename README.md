# Azure Sphere Samples

Note:  This repository was originally forked from the Microsoft GitHub repo (https://github.com/Azure/azure-sphere-samples).  Avnet is adding our own samples in the Samples folder.  Any Avnet content will have Avnet prepended to the sample folder name.


This repository contains samples for the [Azure Sphere platform](https://www.microsoft.com/azure-sphere/).

Please also see the Codethink, MediaTek, and Azure RTOS repositories for more sample applications for the MT3620
real-time cores.

## Using the samples
See the [Azure Sphere Getting Started](https://www.microsoft.com/en-us/azure-sphere/get-started/) page for details on getting an [Azure Sphere development kit](https://aka.ms/AzureSphereHardware) and setting up your PC for development. You should complete the Azure Sphere [Installation Quickstarts](https://docs.microsoft.com/azure-sphere/install/overview) and [Tutorials](https://docs.microsoft.com/azure-sphere/install/qs-overview) to validate that your environment is configured properly before using the samples here. 

Clone this entire repository locally. The repository includes the [hardware definition files](./HardwareDefinitions/) that are required to run the samples on a range of Azure Sphere hardware.

Each folder within the samples subdirectory contains a README.md file that describes the samples therein. Follow the instructions for each individual sample to build and deploy it to your Azure Sphere hardware to learn about the features that the sample demonstrates.
