# Azure Sphere Samples
This repository contains samples for the [Azure Sphere platform](https://www.microsoft.com/azure-sphere/).

## Using the samples
See the [Azure Sphere Getting Started](https://www.microsoft.com/en-us/azure-sphere/get-started/) page for details on getting an [Azure Sphere Development kit](https://aka.ms/AzureSpheredevkits) and setting up your PC for development. You should complete the Azure Sphere [Installation](https://docs.microsoft.com/azure-sphere/install/overview) and [Quickstarts](https://docs.microsoft.com/azure-sphere/quickstarts/qs-overview) to validate that your environment is configured properly before using the samples here. 

Clone this repository locally. Each folder within the samples subdirectory is a self-contained sample and contains a README.md file that describes the sample. You can then build and deploy the sample to your Azure Sphere development kit to learn about the features that the sample demonstrates.
