# Tutorials: Memory Usage

The goal of this tutorial is to demonstrate how to use the Visual Studio memory usage profiler to analyze the memory usage reported when the application allocates memory on the heap.

To achieve this, the tutorial is presented in two stages:

 * [Stage 1](Stage1/) - provides an implementation of an application that has a memory leak and shows how to find and fix it.
 * [Stage 2](Stage2/) - provides the correct implementation of the application.
